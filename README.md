# Surreal-Fish
Surreal Fish is the project name for an open source action-packed third person RPG.
Controls ought to be fairly similar to those in Smite and Tera, and weapon/ability system to be common to those who've played Guild Wars 2 before, but with no classes.

More detailed info as the game progresses in it's making.
